Clustering by Nonparametric Smoothing

Implements the clustering algorithm described by Hofmeyr, D.P. (2025) "Clustering by Nonparametric Smoothin", ArXiv. The method is based on iterative non-parametric smoothing with nearest neighbours, and automatically selects the number of clusters as well all other tuning parameters.
